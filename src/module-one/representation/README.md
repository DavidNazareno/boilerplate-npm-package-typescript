# Representation

The `representation` folder contains the components and hooks related to the user interface of your package. This section is focused on how the core logic and functionalities of your package are presented and interacted with in a user-facing context, often within web applications.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `representation` folder is to:

1. **Encapsulate UI Logic**: Manage the state and behavior of the UI components.
2. **Provide React Components**: Implement reusable React components that represent the user interface.
3. **Custom Hooks**: Create custom React hooks that encapsulate logic and state management, making it easy to integrate with the core functionalities.
4. **Facilitate Integration**: Serve as the bridge between the core logic and the user interface, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.

## What to Put Here

### Components

- **React Components**: Implement reusable and modular React components.
- **Examples**: Form components, display components, interactive widgets.

### Hooks

- **Custom Hooks**: Create hooks to manage state and logic that can be reused across different components.
- **Examples**: State management hooks, data fetching hooks, custom utility hooks.
